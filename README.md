# hao-backprop-test
Test project for backprop integration using Python and Flask. Do not touch!

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system
   ```
   python --version
   ```

2. Install required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Start the server by running:
```
python app.py
```

The server will be available at http://127.0.0.1:3000/

All HTTP requests to the server will receive a "Hello, World!" response with a 200 status code.

## Purpose

This is a minimal Flask-based HTTP server designed specifically for backprop integration testing. It provides a stable, controlled environment with predictable responses.
