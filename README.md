# hao-backprop-test
Test project for backprop integration. Do not touch!

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask 2.0.1

## Setup
1. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix/MacOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the server
Start the server with:
```
python app.py
```

The server will run at http://127.0.0.1:3000/ and respond with "Hello, World!" to all HTTP requests.

## Note
This is a controlled test environment for backprop integration testing. Please do not modify any files as this may affect test results.
